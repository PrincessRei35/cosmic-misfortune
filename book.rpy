    j "So, this book claims that we are in what's collectively known as a shadow realm. It also states that it is created when a bunch of negative energy is built up over time."
    j "Alot of these creatures we have been seeing are based off either common fears of people or are just abnormal creatures that exist only in fiction."
    j "There seems to be multiple ways to escape out of here. One way it says is to confront the fears, but well I fear that it would be deadly to attempt such a method."
    j "So I say we try a safer route, now if we can get to the source of why this place has manifested, we can stop it at the root of it all. Though judging from what you told me, this place has originated from you somehow Cosmo."
    j "It is also likely we are not the only ones that are still alive, do you know of anyone who we should try and see if they are safe and sound outside of this realm?"

    j "If we can find those, then we can get the heck out of here, but only after we destroy them."
    j "Well it does not seem like the book describes where these items are... So I guess we are just gonna have to search all of Guishan."
